Consider a simple, non-empty Graph $G = (V, E)$ comprising a set of Edges $E$ and vertices $E$.
For specificity, $E(G)$ and $V(G)$ is used to refer to the set of edges and vertices associated
with Graph $G$ respectively, where required.Further, denote by $|V|$ the cardinality of set of
vertices $V$, let $G$ be a Graph with $|V(G)| = |\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \}| = n$ vertices and
$|E(G)| = m$ edges with $E \subset \binom{V}{2} $;
where $\binom{V}{2} = \left\{\left\langle u,v\right\rangle | u,v \in V, u \neq v \right\} $, that is,
the set of all possible unordered pairs created from $V$. For each $e = \left\langle u, v\right\rangle \in E$,
$e$ is said to be incident on $u,v\in V$, whereas $u$ and $v$ are adjacent to each other.

The Neighbor set $\mathcal{N}(v)$ of $v \in V$, defined as
$\mathcal{N}(v) =: \left\{w  \in V(G) | v \neq w, \exists e \in E(G)\right\} $  is the set of vertices
(other than $v$) adjacent to $v \tilde{\mathcal{V}}  \bar{\mathcal{V}}$. Given a Graph $\mathcal{G}$,
$\mathcal{G} \subseteq G$ denotes that $\mathcal{G}$ is a subgraph of $G$, if it holds that
$\forall e \in E(\mathcal{G}),  \; u,v \subseteq V(\mathcal{G})$, $V(\mathcal{G}) \subseteq V(G)$
and $E(\mathcal{G}) \subseteq E(G)$.

The adjacency matrix of a weighted graph $G$ is a symmetric matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with $i$th row and $j$th column containing the number of edges incident on vertex $v_i$ and $v_j$.
More precisely, let $\omega : \left\{ 0,1 \right\} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ for $i,j \in \left\{1,2, \ldots, n \right\} $

\begin{equation}\label{eqn: adj_matrix}
  A_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
    \omega (e_i), & \qquad e_i = \left\langle v_i, v_j\right\rangle \in E(G) \\
    0,            & \qquad \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
By restricting \eqref{eqn: adj_matrix} $\omega \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\} \;\forall  \omega  (e_i), \; e_i  \in E$, we recover the
adjacency matrix of an unweighted graph. The volume $vol(F)$ of a a subset of nodes $F \in V$ is the sum of weight of edges adjacent
to the nodes of $F$ and given as $vol(F) = \sum_{v_i \in F}  \delta(v_i)$; where $\delta(v_i)$ is the degree of vertex $v_i$ obtained
as the sum of the weights of edges incident on it: $\delta(v_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i,j} $.

Denote the number of components in of graph $G$ by $\kappa(G)$. For the a set $V^* \subseteq V(G)$, $V^*$ is a cut-vertex
if $\kappa(G[V(G)\backslash V^* = \tilde{V} ]) > \kappa(G)$
